## Light Exposure Behaviour Assessment (LEBA) - English language

### About

The **Light Exposure Behaviour Assessment (LEBA)** instrument is a novel instrument for capturing, assessing and quantifying self-reported behaviours related to light exposure in humans.

**Note: This GitHub repository contains developmental versions of the instrument.** For archival and version-stamped releases of the instrument versions, please visit the [OSF page (DOI: 10.17605/OSF.IO/EZ6GJ)](https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/EZ6GJ).

### Instructions

LEBA captures light exposure-related behaviours on a 5-point Likert type scale ranging from 1 to 5 (1 = never; 2 = rarely; 3 = sometimes; 4 = often; 5 = always). Each factor is scored by adding up all the corresponding item scores. Respondents are requested to rate the frequency of the behaviours given in each item in a retrospective manner (**past four weeks**) to capture their propensity for different light exposure-related behaviours.

#### Qualtrics

All files relevant for the [Qualtrics](https://www.qualtrics.com/) platform can be found under `qualtrics/`. This folder contains the following files:

- `LEBA-long.qsf`
- `LEBA_short.qsf`

These QSF files are generated using the **Qualtrics** platform. These QSF files can be directly imported into Qualtrics. To create a project from these QSF files, after logging into your Qualtrics account, click on the global navigation icon located in the top-left, next to the XM logo and go to **Catalog** -> **Survey** -> **Get started**. On this page, in the  **Name** field, please enter the name for your survey. In the **How do you want to start your survey?** field, please select **Import a QSF file** from the drop-down list and click **Create Project**. After clicking **Create project**, you will be automatically taken to the survey tab.

#### REDCap

All relevant files for the [REDCap](https://www.project-redcap.org/) platform can be found under `redcap/`. This folder contains the following files:

- `LEBA-long-form.zip`
- `LEBA_short-form.zip`

These ZIP files can be directly imported into REDCap. To import the ZIP files into your REDCap project, go to **Project Setup** -> **Online Designer** -> **Upload instrument ZIP file from another project/user or external libraries**. This will prompt you to select a file on your computer. After uploading the ZIP files, the questionnaire will be integrated into your project's instruments.

In addition to the ZIP files, the `redcap/` folder also contains the following sub-folders:

- `LEBA_long_form/`
- `LEBA_short_form/`

These are the unzipped, decompressed versions of the zip files above. If you prefer to enter the instrument directly in your project's data dictionary, you can use the files called `instrument.csv` for this.
