## Light Exposure Behaviour Assessment (LEBA) - English language

### About

The **Light Exposure Behaviour Assessment (LEBA)** instrument is a novel instrument for capturing, assessing and quantifying self-reported behaviours related to light exposure in humans.

### Citing

If you are using the instrument, please cite the instrument's repository as well as our preprint on the topic:

### Instructions

LEBA captures light exposure-related behaviours on a 5 point Likert type scale ranging from 1 to 5 (Never = 1; Rarely = 2; Sometimes = 3; Often = 4; Always = 5). The score of each factor is calculated by the summation of scores of items belonging to the corresponding factor. Respondends are requested to respond to each item in a retrospective manner where they try to capture their propensity of different light exposure related behaviors in the **past 4 weeks.**" 

This repository contains:

- Sharable pdf versions of **Long and Short forms of LEBA** 
- Qualtrics templates of **Long and Short forms of LEBA**
- Redcap templates of **Long and Short forms of LEBA**


#### Qualtrics

All files relevant for the [Qualtrics](https://www.qualtrics.com/) platform can be found under `qualtrics/`. This folder contains the following files:

- `LEBA-long.qsf`
- `LEBA_short.qsf`

These QSF files are generated using **Qualtrics** platform. These QSF files can be directly imported into Qualtrics. To create a project from these QSF files, after logging into your Qualtrics account, click on the global navigation icon located in the top-left, next to the XM logo and go to **Catalog** -> **Survey** -> **Get started**. On this page, in the  **Name** field please enter the name for your survey. In the **How do you want to start your survey?** field, please select **"Import a QSF file"** from the drop-down list and click **"Create Project"**. After clicking **"Create project"**, you will be automatically taken to the survey tab.

#### REDCap

All files relevant for the [REDCap](https://www.project-redcap.org/) platform can be found under `redcap/`. This folder contains the following files:

- `LEBA-long-form.zip`
- `LEBA_short-form.zip`

These ZIP files can be directly imported in REDCap. To import the ZIP files in your REDCap project, go to **Project Setup** -> **Online Designer** -> **Upload instrument ZIP file from another project/user or external libraries**. This will prompt you to select a file on your computer. After uploading the ZIP files, the instrument will be integrated in your project's instruments.

In addition to the ZIP files, the `redcap/` folder also contains the following sub-folders:

- `LEBA_long_form/`
- `LEBA_short_form/`

These correspond to the are the unzipped, decompressed versions of the zip files above. If you prefer to enter the instrument directly in your project's data dictionary, you can use the files called `instrument.csv` for this.
