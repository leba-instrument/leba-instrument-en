All files relevant for the [REDCap](https://www.project-redcap.org/) platform can be found under `redcap/`. This folder contains the following files:

- `LEBA-long-form.zip`
- `LEBA_short-form.zip`

These ZIP files can be directly imported in REDCap. To import the ZIP files in your REDCap project, go to **Project Setup** -> **Online Designer** -> **Upload instrument ZIP file from another project/user or external libraries**. This will prompt you to select a file on your computer. After uploading the ZIP files, the instrument will be integrated in your project's instruments.

In addition to the ZIP files, the `redcap/` folder also contains the following sub-folders:

- `LEBA_long_form/`
